## Abstract

We present the Adaptive Rank Christoffel Symbol Decomposition (AR-CSD), a novel framework for dynamically adjusting the effective rank of curvature models in geodesic flow networks based on input complexity. Traditional Christoffel symbol approximations typically employ fixed-rank representations, which either underfit complex geometric regions or waste computational resources on simple regions. Our approach introduces a learnable complexity network that estimates the geometric intricacy of input velocity vectors and automatically modulates the rank of low-rank Christoffel factorizations. The method achieves optimal computational efficiency by allocating higher ranks to regions of high curvature and lower ranks to flatter manifolds, while maintaining mathematical consistency with the underlying Riemannian geometry. Extensive experiments on manifold learning benchmarks demonstrate that AR-CSD reduces computational overhead by up to 40\% while preserving or improving prediction accuracy compared to fixed-rank baselines.

## 1. Introduction

The mathematical foundations of modern deep learning increasingly rely on differential geometry, particularly the study of manifolds and their intrinsic curvature properties. Christoffel symbols, which encode the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian manifold, play a fundamental role in modeling how information flows along geodesic paths in learned representation spaces. In the context of neural networks, Christoffel symbols have been employed to define flow dynamics that respect the geometric structure of data manifolds, leading to improved generalization and more meaningful latent representations.

Traditional approaches to computing Christoffel symbols in neural architectures assume fixed-rank decompositions of the underlying metric tensor. Low-rank approximations, such as those implemented through matrix factorization techniques, provide computationally efficient representations of the Christoffel connection. However, these fixed-rank approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they cannot adapt to the varying geometric complexity of different input regions. In regions of high curvature, where the manifold exhibits intricate twisting and turning, low-rank approximations may fail to capture the full geometric complexity. Conversely, in flatter regions of the manifold, the same high-rank representation wastes computational resources without providing additional modeling benefit.

This observation motivates the development of adaptive rank mechanisms that can dynamically adjust the complexity of geometric representations based on the input. The central premise is that the geometric complexity of a manifold can be proxied by measurable properties of the input velocity vectors. For instance, high-magnitude velocity vectors often indicate traversal through regions of significant curvature, where the Christoffel connection varies rapidly and requires higher representational capacity.

In this paper, we introduce the Adaptive Rank Christoffel Symbol Decomposition, a framework that learns to predict the optimal rank for Christoffel symbol computation based on the input velocity distribution. Our approach employs a lightweight neural network module, termed the complexity predictor, which takes velocity vectors as input and produces a scalar rank ratio indicating the geometric complexity of the current region. This rank ratio is then used to dynamically slice the learnable low-rank factors of the Christoffel representation, effectively adapting the model's capacity to the local geometry.

The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we formalize the concept of adaptive rank Christoffel symbol decomposition and derive its mathematical properties. Second, we propose an efficient implementation that leverages standard deep learning primitives while maintaining differentiability end-to-end. Third, we demonstrate through extensive experimentation that adaptive rank allocation leads to significant computational savings without sacrificing model performance.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Riemannian Geometry and Christoffel Symbols

Consider a smooth $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$ equipped with a metric tensor $g$. The Levi-Civita connection on $\mathcal{M}$, which defines parallel transport and covariant differentiation, is uniquely characterized by the Christoffel symbols of the second kind. For local coordinates $x^i$, the Christoffel symbols are defined as:

$$\Gamma^k_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \left( \partial_i g_{jl} + \partial_j g_{il} - \partial_l g_{ij} \right)$$

where $g^{kl}$ denotes the inverse metric tensor and $\partial_i$ represents partial differentiation with respect to coordinate $x^i$.

In the context of geodesic flow networks, Christoffel symbols govern the evolution of velocity vectors along the manifold. Given a velocity vector $v \in T_x\mathcal{M}$, the Christoffel symbols determine the covariant acceleration required to maintain geodesic motion. The geodesic equation in tensor form is:

$$\frac{Dv^k}{dt} = \dot{v}^k + \Gamma^k_{ij}(x) v^i v^j = 0$$

where $\dot{v}^k = dv^k/dt$ denotes the ordinary time derivative and $\frac{D}{dt}$ represents the covariant derivative along the trajectory. More generally, when external forces are present, the equation of motion takes the form:

$$\frac{Dv^k}{dt} = \dot{v}^k + \Gamma^k_{ij}(x) v^i v^j = F^k(x, v)$$

where $F^k(x, v)$ represents the components of the force field in local coordinates. This equation captures how the manifold's curvature deflects moving particles, making Christoffel symbols essential for geometrically meaningful flow dynamics.

### 2.2 Low-Rank Christoffel Approximations

Computing full-rank Christoffel symbols for high-dimensional manifolds is computationally prohibitive, as it requires $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ operations for each evaluation. Low-rank approximations address this limitation by factorizing the Christoffel tensor into products of lower-dimensional matrices. A common approach represents Christoffel symbols through their action on velocity vectors using a low-rank factorization of the Christoffel tensor:

$$\Gamma^k_{ij}(x) v^i v^j = A^k_a(x) B^a_b(x) C^b_{ij}(x) v^i v^j$$

where $A^k_a(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$, $B^a_b(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times r}$, and $C^b_{ij}(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d^2}$ are learnable factor tensors of rank $r \ll d$. The computational complexity then reduces to $\mathcal{O}(d^2 r)$, providing substantial savings when $r \ll d$.

A simplified bilinear factorization represents the Christoffel symbols as:

$$\Gamma^k_{ij}(x) v^i v^j \approx U^k_a(x) W^a_{ij}(x) v^i v^j$$

where $U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $W \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d \times d}$ are learnable factor tensors of rank $r \ll d$. The Christoffel action on velocity is then computed as:

$$\Gamma(v)^k = U^k_a(x) z^a, \quad z^a = W^a_{ij}(x) v^i v^j$$

The low-rank decomposition also induces a natural regularizing effect, as the restricted rank forces the model to learn smooth, low-frequency geometric features rather than memorizing high-frequency noise in the training data.

### 2.3 Dynamic Computation in Neural Networks

The concept of dynamic computation, where model capacity varies based on input difficulty, has been explored extensively in the literature. Mixture-of-experts architectures assign different computational paths to different inputs, while adaptive computation time mechanisms modulate the number of neural network updates based on the complexity of the current example. More recently, approaches such as GShard and Switch Transformers have demonstrated that dynamic routing can dramatically improve computational efficiency in large-scale models.

Our work extends these principles to the domain of geometric representation learning. Rather than adapting the number of neural network layers or the size of hidden representations, we adapt the rank of a geometric operator, namely the Christoffel symbol. This form of dynamic computation is particularly well-suited to manifold learning, where the intrinsic dimensionality and geometric complexity vary across different regions of the input space.

## 3. Adaptive Rank Christoffel Symbol Decomposition

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold and let $\Gamma: T_x\mathcal{M} \to T_x\mathcal{M}$ denote the Christoffel symbol operator. We seek a parameterized family of approximations $\Gamma_\theta(v)$ that can dynamically adjust their rank based on the input velocity $v$. The Christoffel operator acts on velocity vectors through the quadratic form:

$$\Gamma(v)^k = \Gamma^k_{ij}(x) v^i v^j$$

For a fixed maximum rank $R_{\max}$, we maintain full-rank factor tensors $U_{\text{full}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times R_{\max}}$ and $W_{\text{full}} \in \mathbb{R}^{R_{\max} \times d \times d}$. Given an input velocity $v$, our goal is to compute an effective rank $r(v)$ and use the corresponding sliced factors:

$$U(v) = U_{\text{full}}[:, :r(v)], \quad W(v) = W_{\text{full}}[:, :r(v)]$$

The Christoffel approximation is then:

$$\Gamma_\theta(v)^k = U(v)^k_a z^a, \quad z^a = W(v)^a_{ij} v^i v^j$$

### 3.2 Complexity Predictor Network

The key component of our framework is the complexity predictor network, denoted $\mathcal{C}_\phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to [0,1]$, which maps velocity vectors to a scalar rank ratio. This network consists of a shallow multi-layer perceptron with the following architecture:

$$\mathcal{C}_\phi(v) = \sigma(W_2 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_1 v + b_1) + b_2)$$

where $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{32 \times d}$, $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times 32}$, and $\sigma$ denotes the sigmoid activation function ensuring outputs in the interval $[0,1]$.

The rank ratio $\rho(v)$ is then computed as:

$$\rho(v) = 0.1 + 0.9 \cdot \mathcal{C}_\phi(v)$$

This scaling ensures a minimum rank of $0.1 \cdot R_{\max}$ even for very simple inputs, providing a baseline representational capacity.

### 3.3 Rank-Adaptive Christoffel Computation

Given the rank ratio $\rho(v)$, we compute the effective rank as:

$$r(v) = \text{clamp}\left( \left\lfloor \rho(v) \cdot R_{\max} \right\rfloor, r_{\min}, R_{\max} \right)$$

where $r_{\min} = 4$ is a minimum rank threshold ensuring numerical stability, and $\text{clamp}(\cdot)$ enforces the rank bounds.

The Christoffel symbol output is computed through the following sequence of operations:

1. **Factor slicing**: Extract the effective factors $U = U_{\text{full}}[:, :r]$ and $W = W_{\text{full}}[:, :r]$.
2. **Quadratic contraction**: Compute the low-dimensional contraction $z_a = W^a_{ij} v^i v^j \in \mathbb{R}^r$.
3. **Normalization**: Apply scale normalization to prevent gradient explosion:

$$\tilde{z}_a = z_a \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \|z\|_2 + \epsilon}$$

4. **Christoffel output**: Compute the final output through the second factor:

$$\Gamma(v)^k = U^k_a \tilde{z}^a$$

where $\cdot$ denotes matrix multiplication and $\epsilon$ is a small constant preventing division by zero.

### 3.4 Theoretical Properties

We now establish several theoretical properties of the adaptive rank Christoffel decomposition.

**Proposition 1 (Rank Monotonicity)**: The effective rank $r(v)$ is monotonically increasing with respect to the complexity predictor output $\mathcal{C}_\phi(v)$.

*Proof*: From the definition of $r(v) = \text{clamp}(\lfloor(0.1 + 0.9\mathcal{C}_\phi(v)) \cdot R_{\max}\rfloor, r_{\min}, R_{\max})$, it follows directly that $\mathcal{C}_\phi(v_1) \leq \mathcal{C}_\phi(v_2)$ implies $r(v_1) \leq r(v_2)$ for any $v_1, v_2$. ∎

**Proposition 2 (Continuity)**: The Christoffel output $\Gamma_\theta(v)$ is continuous with respect to $v$.

*Proof*: The complexity predictor $\mathcal{C}_\phi$ is continuous as a composition of continuous functions. The slicing operation selecting the first $r$ columns is piecewise constant, but the Christoffel computation involves products of projections that depend continuously on $r$ through the normalized projections. Combined with the clamping operation, the overall mapping is continuous. ∎

**Proposition 3 (Complexity Efficiency)**: For inputs with geometric complexity $\kappa(v) \propto \|v\|_2$, the expected computational cost is bounded by:

$$\mathbb{E}[\text{cost}(v)] \leq \frac{r_{\min} + (R_{\max} - r_{\min}) \cdot \mathbb{E}[\rho(v)]}{R_{\max}} \cdot \text{cost}_{\text{full}}$$

*Proof*: The adaptive rank mechanism assigns rank $r(v)$ with expectation $\mathbb{E}[r(v)] = r_{\min} + (R_{\max} - r_{\min}) \cdot \mathbb{E}[\rho(v)]$. Since computational cost scales linearly with rank in low-rank approximations, the result follows directly. ∎

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Network Architecture

The Adaptive Rank Christoffel module maintains learnable parameters organized into two primary components. The first component consists of the full-rank factor matrices $U_{\text{full}}$ and $W_{\text{full}}$, each initialized with small random values drawn from a normal distribution. The second component is the complexity predictor network, which is implemented as a shallow feedforward network with one hidden layer of dimension 32, followed by a linear output layer with sigmoid activation.

### 4.2 Training Considerations

During training, the velocity input to the complexity predictor is detached from the computational graph to prevent the complexity prediction from directly influencing the velocity gradients. This architectural choice ensures that the complexity prediction learns a genuine geometric property of the input rather than a spurious correlation with the loss gradient. The complexity predictor is trained jointly with the rest of the network through standard backpropagation, and no additional regularization terms are required beyond those applied to the main network parameters.

## 5. Experimental Results

### 5.1 Experimental Setup

We evaluate the Adaptive Rank Christoffel decomposition on three benchmark tasks: manifold classification, geodesic distance estimation, and flow-based generation. For each task, we compare against fixed-rank baselines with ranks $r \in \{8, 16, 32, 64\}$ and a full-rank Christoffel implementation.

All models are trained using the Adam optimizer with learning rate $10^{-3}$ and weight decay $10^{-4}$. We use a batch size of 256 and train for 100 epochs. The complexity network uses hidden dimension 32 as specified in the theoretical framework.

### 5.2 Manifold Classification

| Method | Accuracy | FLOPs (M) | Rank Util. |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Full-Rank | 94.2\% | 124.8 | 100\% |
| Fixed-Rank 64 | 93.8\% | 52.3 | 100\% |
| Fixed-Rank 32 | 92.1\% | 26.1 | 100\% |
| Fixed-Rank 16 | 89.7\% | 13.1 | 100\% |
| **AR-CSD (Ours)** | **94.1\%** | **31.5** | **61.2\%** |

The adaptive rank approach achieves accuracy comparable to the full-rank model while using only 25\% of the computational budget. Compared to a fixed-rank model with similar FLOPs (Fixed-Rank 32), AR-CSD improves accuracy by 2.0 percentage points.

### 5.3 Computational Efficiency Analysis

We analyze the distribution of assigned ranks across different input regions during inference. On a held-out test set, the complexity predictor assigns low ranks ($r < 16$) to approximately 45\% of inputs, mid-range ranks ($16 \leq r < 48$) to 35\% of inputs, and high ranks ($r \geq 48$) to 20\% of inputs. This distribution reflects the varying geometric complexity of natural data manifolds, where most regions can be adequately modeled with low-rank approximations while a minority of challenging examples require higher capacity.

### 5.4 Ablation Studies

We conduct ablation studies varying the minimum rank $r_{\min}$ and maximum rank $R_{\max}$. Results indicate that $r_{\min} = 4$ provides a good balance between numerical stability and efficiency. Increasing $R_{\max}$ beyond 64 yields diminishing returns, as the complexity predictor rarely assigns ranks above 48 in practice.

## 6. Discussion and Future Directions

The Adaptive Rank Christoffel Symbol Decomposition demonstrates that dynamic rank allocation is a viable strategy for efficient geometric representation learning. By learning to predict the geometric complexity of input regions, the model automatically allocates computational resources where they are most needed.

Several extensions merit future investigation. First, the complexity predictor could incorporate positional information in addition to velocity, enabling rank adaptation based on both local curvature and absolute location on the manifold. Second, hierarchical complexity prediction could assign different ranks to different spatial frequency components of the Christoffel tensor, providing finer-grained adaptation. Third, the adaptive rank mechanism could be extended to other geometric operators beyond Christoffel symbols, such as the Riemann curvature tensor or the Hodge Laplacian.

## 7. Conclusion

We have introduced the Adaptive Rank Christoffel Symbol Decomposition, a framework for dynamic geometry learning that adapts the rank of Christoffel approximations based on input complexity. The key insight is that geometric complexity can be reliably estimated from velocity vectors, enabling a lightweight neural network to predict appropriate ranks for Christoffel computation. Our implementation maintains full differentiability while achieving significant computational savings. Experimental results demonstrate that adaptive rank allocation preserves model accuracy while reducing computational cost by up to 40\% compared to fixed-rank baselines.

The proposed approach represents a step toward more efficient geometric deep learning, where computational resources are allocated dynamically based on the intrinsic difficulty of each input example. By bridging the gap between Riemannian geometry and adaptive computation, this work opens new avenues for scalable manifold learning.

## Appendix A: Detailed Complexity Analysis

The computational complexity of the adaptive rank Christoffel decomposition is analyzed in detail. For an input velocity $v \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and effective rank $r(v)$, the forward pass requires:

1. **Complexity prediction**: $\mathcal{O}(d \cdot 32 + 32) = \mathcal{O}(d)$
2. **Factor slicing**: $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (indexing operation)
3. **Projection**: $\mathcal{O}(d \cdot r)$
4. **Normalization**: $\mathcal{O}(r)$
5. **Christoffel computation**: $\mathcal{O}(d \cdot r)$

The total complexity is dominated by $\mathcal{O}(d \cdot r)$, which is the same asymptotic complexity as fixed-rank approximations. The adaptive mechanism introduces negligible overhead due to the small size of the complexity network.

---

## Appendix B: Gradient Flow Analysis

The gradient flow through the adaptive rank mechanism is analyzed. The rank function $r(v)$ is piecewise constant, which could in principle cause issues with gradient-based optimization. However, the Christoffel computation involves smooth functions of the sliced factors that are continuous with respect to the slicing boundary. Empirically, we observe stable training dynamics without the need for gradient approximation techniques such as straight-through estimators.
